# Task ID: 10
# Title: Build Strategy Generation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop core algorithms to generate strategies using technical, sentiment, price action, and economic event signals.
# Details:
Implement modular strategy templates for trend, range, breakout, sentiment, news, multi-timeframe, and pairs trading. Use genetic algorithms (DEAP v1.3.1) for optimization. Integrate Monte Carlo simulation and walk-forward testing.

# Test Strategy:
Generate sample strategies, validate logical consistency, and run optimization cycles for robustness.
