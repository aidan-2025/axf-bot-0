# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Real-Time Market Data Ingestion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop Python modules to ingest tick-level price data from multiple broker APIs with <100ms latency.
# Details:
Integrate with broker APIs (e.g., OANDA v20, FXCM REST API). Use asyncio for concurrency. Implement failover and redundancy. Cache recent data in Redis. Store historical data in InfluxDB.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate data feed interruptions, measure latency, and validate data completeness and accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up broker API integrations (OANDA v20, FXCM REST) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure API clients for major forex brokers with authentication and rate limiting
### Details:
- Implement OANDA v20 API client with proper authentication
- Add FXCM REST API integration as backup
- Configure API rate limiting and error handling
- Set up environment variables for API keys

## 2. Implement asyncio-based data ingestion engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create high-performance async data ingestion system with concurrency and error handling
### Details:
- Build asyncio-based data ingestion engine
- Implement concurrent data fetching from multiple sources
- Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Ensure <100ms latency requirements

## 3. Implement Redis caching layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Redis for real-time data caching and fast access
### Details:
- Configure Redis connection and caching strategies
- Implement real-time data caching for recent market data

## 5. Implement failover and redundancy mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add robust failover and redundancy for continuous data ingestion
### Details:
- Implement automatic failover between data sources
- Add redundancy for critical data streams
- Create health monitoring and alerting
- Ensure data continuity during outages

## 6. Create data validation and quality checks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive data validation and quality assurance
### Details:
- Add data validation for price accuracy and completeness
- Implement anomaly detection for market data
- Create data quality metrics and reporting

## 7. Implement performance monitoring and testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive testing and monitoring for data ingestion performance
### Details:
- Implement latency monitoring and alerting
- Create performance benchmarks and testing
- Add data completeness validation
- Test failover scenarios and recovery
