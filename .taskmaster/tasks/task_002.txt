# Task ID: 2
# Title: Provision Development and Testing Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a local, containerized development and testing environment for all core services, supporting Python and MQL4 workflows.
# Details:
Provision Docker containers for Application 1 (Python), Application 2 (MQL4/MT4), Web UI, PostgreSQL, and Redis. Configure local networking between containers using Docker Compose. Implement database initialization and migration scripts for PostgreSQL. Create development workflow scripts and Makefile commands for automation. Set up monitoring, health checks, and logging for all services in the local environment. Manage environment variables and secrets securely for local development. Provide comprehensive development documentation and setup guides. Ensure all services can be started, stopped, and tested locally using Docker Compose.

# Test Strategy:
Run Docker Compose to start all services locally. Validate service connectivity, database schema initialization, and Redis caching. Test backup and restoration of local databases. Verify health checks and monitoring outputs. Ensure all development scripts and Makefile commands execute successfully. Review documentation by following setup steps on a clean machine.
