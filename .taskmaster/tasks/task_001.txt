# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project Repositories and Version Control
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Project repositories for both applications have been fully initialized on GitHub, with comprehensive CI/CD, branching, security, and project management best practices implemented.
# Details:
Repositories were created on GitHub with main, develop, and feature branches. GitHub Actions workflows were set up for automated linting, testing, security scans, Docker builds, and deployments to staging and production. Branch protection rules enforce code review and status checks. A repository setup script automates configuration, including branch setup, protection rules, and initial project structure. Comprehensive documentation was added: README with badges and setup instructions, CONTRIBUTING.md, and SECURITY.md. Security scanning (including Dependabot, secret scanning, and code scanning) is enabled. A project board and initial issues were created for development tracking. The repository structure is organized for clarity and maintainability, following best practices for folder organization and metadata. All workflows and guidelines are in place for collaborative development.

# Test Strategy:
Repository access, branch protection, and CI/CD pipelines were verified with sample commits. Automated tests, security scans, and Docker builds run successfully on pull requests. Documentation, contribution guidelines, and project management tools were reviewed for completeness and accessibility.
